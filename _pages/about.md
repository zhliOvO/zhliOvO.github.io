<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Zhuoheng Li, and I am currently a senior student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

I am pursuing a dual degree program through the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Michigan Joint Institute. Upon graduation, I will hold a Bachelor of Electrical and Computer Engineering from SJTU and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics from Umich. I have conducted several researches under the guidance of Professors [Zhenhui Li](https://jessielzh.com), [Guanjie Zheng](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~gjzheng/), [Yi Shi](https://yishi.sjtu.edu.cn), [Zhuoran Song](https://songzhuoran.github.io), and [Justin Kasper](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/kasper-justin-c/).

My research interests encompass AI for Science, Data Mining, and Large Language Models.
