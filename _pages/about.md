<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Zhuoheng Li, a Ph.D. student at Penn State University in the College of Information Sciences and Technology.

Previously, I completed a dual degree program through the University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a Bachelor of Electrical and Computer Engineering from SJTU.

I have conducted several researches under the guidance of Professors [Zhenhui Li](https://jessielzh.com), [Guanjie Zheng](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~gjzheng/), [Yi Shi](https://yishi.sjtu.edu.cn), [Zhuoran Song](https://songzhuoran.github.io), and [Justin Kasper](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/kasper-justin-c/).

My current research interests lie in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Extended Reality (XR), with a focus on their intersection with security and spatial temporal applications.
