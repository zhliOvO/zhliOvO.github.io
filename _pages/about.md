I am Zhuoheng Li and I study at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

I am currently in a dual degree program in Shanghai Jiaotong University and University of Michigan Joint Institute. I will be graduating with Bachelor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in SJTU and Bachelor of Science, Computer Science, Minor in Mathematics in Umich. I did several researches supervised by Zhenhui Li, Guanjie Zheng, Zhuoran Song, and Justin Kasper.

My research interest includes AI for Science, Data Mining, Large Language Model and Computer Vision. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6lA1lrIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
